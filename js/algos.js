//given an array of words, find the length of each word. Start with two
//variables, a index, a counter and a temporary placeholder. These variables will keep
//count of what word you look at. Set both variables to 0 and as you go through
//each element in the array and look at their lenght, store their length in the
//temporary placeholder variable. if the temporary placeholder is greater than
// the counter, then the make counter equal to the value of the temporary placeholder
// and save the index value by setting it equal to index. Do this for the entire
//lenght of the array and then return the value element at the index with greatest
//word length
