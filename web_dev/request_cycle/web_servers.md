In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
  Like a physical server, a virtual private server is a server with the ability
  to run its own operating system, or any that the user wishes to install. Unlike,
  a physical server, a virtual private server allows for more flexibility with
  creating software, since it is essentially a blank slate for which users to
  scribe on.

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
  The root user is the one user in a linux server that has all the privileges to
  install software, edit code, delete folders, etc. If you run programs as a root user,
  then much like the master branch on git workflow, any decision will have a consequence,
  and going back to an older state may be more difficult.
